%% 1. Randomly Sampled Texture (10 pts)
% read image into imsample and call quilt_random function
im2sample = im2single(imread('./../sample/tmt1.jpg'));
imrandom = quilt_random(im2sample, 400, 50);
figure;
imshow(imrandom);

%% 2. Overlapping Patches (30 pts)
% read image in imsample and call quilt_simple function
% use only odd positive integers for patchsize for now
im2sample = im2single(imread('./../sample/tmt1.jpg'));
imoverlap = quilt_simple(im2sample, 400, 25, 4, 0.01);
figure;
imshow(imoverlap);

%% 3. Seam finding (20 pts)
% use cut.m to find a cut in the image and combine both images  
% use this method to combine two overlapping images
im2sample = im2single(imread('./../sample/tmt1.jpg'));
imoverlap = quilt_cut(im2sample, 800, 25, 4, 0.01);
figure;
imshow(imoverlap);

%% 4. Texture Transfer (30 pts)
% use quilt_cut.m and the texture_transfer algorithm
