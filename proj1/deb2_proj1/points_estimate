I think I deserve 105 points on this assignment. 

The following is a breakdown:

1. 45 points for implementation to create hybrid images from two aligned input images. 

-completed for 3 pairs of images with 2 good and 1 failure case)

2. 25 points for illustration and additional results: 15 points for FFT images; 10 points for including at least two examples beyond the first (including at least one failure).

-completed for a pair of images and hybrid FFTs for all images with one failure.

3. 10 points for quality of results (e.g., 0=poor 5=average 10=great 15=amazing)

-good quality outputs -image size can be opened in new tab (15 amazing)

4. 20 points for two image enhancement tasks (10 pts each), including explanation and display of results.

-completed both image enhancement tasks - contrast and color enhancement
